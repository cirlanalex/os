/**
 * Parsing in flex is done based on a series of regexes. Below, we list these regexes
 * in order, flex will try to match the input with these in order. As soon as any regex
 * matches, it will run the code associated with it. Because of this order, we should
 * put our more specific regexes at the top: put a match for "exit" before a general
 * string regex.
 *
 * Optionally, you can specify a "start condition" (you can see it as some sort of
 * context) for a rule. This causes the regex to only be tried when the parsing is
 * in this context. You can control the current context using BEGIN(). The default
 * start condition is "INITIAL". So below, as soon as we hit a " char, we enter the
 * "STRING" context that will enable us to match any character until the next ",
 * after which we return to the "INITIAL" context.
 *
 * You could decide to hook up Bison to this part as well, as can be seen in many
 * tutorials online. Then you would store/return tokens from the actions in these rules.
 * However, for the scope of this simple grammar for the shell, that is really not
 * necessary and a few state variables should suffice to get the functionality you need!
